//card game woop (ugh I hate myself rn XD)
//soooo, first, a card object. make an arraylist of them. 
//then add a title screen and a game screen and a gameover screen
//when you click on them they flip oer and there are pictures...for now nuebrs, but each has its own number and must shuffle each new game 
//eventually two player mode!
//and optional themes, like numbers, animals, fruit, colors--probably gonna start with colors anyway cus it's eeeeeasy
